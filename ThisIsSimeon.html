<b>This Is Simeon</b><br>
<br>
A story from Ascetics in the World, Vol 1.<br><br>
In mid-20th century, in the Greek city of Peiraia, lived a man, a father and husband, Simeon.  
Each morning on his way to work as a porter at the Port of Peiraia, Simeon would stop at 
St. Spyridon Church and stand before the icons of Christ, the Theotokos, and Saints.  
He would say “Good morning, my Christ. I am Simeon.  Help me to earn my daily bread.”  
Later at night on his way home, he would stop at the church and say “Thank you for helping me again today.”
As time went by, Simeon’s family all died from tuberculosis and he was left alone.  
He continued to work keeping his habit of stopping at St. Spyridon Church. Simeon, too, eventually 
contracted tuberculosis and was hospitalized.  One day, a nurse mentioned to Simeon that no one visits him.
He replied, “Every morning and every afternoon Christ comes and consoles me.  Christ says 
‘Good morning, Simeon, I am Christ. Be patient.’ In the afternoon, He says ‘Good afternoon, Simeon. 
I am Christ. Be patient.’”   The nurse, concerned that Simeon was having delusions, contacted her priest 
and told the priest about Simeon. The priest visited Simeon and asked about the visits from Christ.  
He told the priest that, yes, it was true.  The priest asked what Christ told Simeon that day.  
Simeon said, “Christ told me ‘Good morning, Simeon, I am Christ. Be patient.  In three days, 
early in the morning, I will take you to be near Me.’” The priest visited with Simeon the next 
couple of days and learned what a blessed man Simeon is. On the third day the priest was visiting Simeon
when Simeon suddenly shouted “Christ has come.” At that moment, Simeon fell asleep with the righteous.  
May his memory be eternal!<br>
